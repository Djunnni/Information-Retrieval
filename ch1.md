## Compare IR and Database

	   | DataBase  | IR	    |
-----------|-----------|------------|
Data | Sturctured | Unstructured |
Fields | Clear semantics | No fileds |
Queries | Defined (SQL) | Free text ("netural language") |
Recoverability | Critical | Downplayed |
Matching | Exact | Imprecise |

- More instruction Recoverability 

ex ) there is a bank. bank has used some of Databases. when he deposit his account,at that instant database system has error.So his money is not recorded.

=> Database Recoverability is Critical

but IR is not critical. we just use other IR :)
